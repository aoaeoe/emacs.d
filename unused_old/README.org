* This is my **GNU Emacs** configuration for python, go and rust.

It requires Emacs version 29 or higher. If needed, you can change the MELPA repository source.

Some shortcuts can be customized, such as `neotree` with `C-c C-t`. If you need it, you should install all-the-icons-fonts. You can also choose treemacs.

I hope it is a lightweight editor.

There might be many configurations that still need to be adjusted.

* Installation

1. Run :

note: unused config
#+BEGIN_src sh
  git clone https://github.com/aoaeoe/emacs.d ~/.emacs.d
#+END_src

2. Launch emacs and wait the package installation.
