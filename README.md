# This is my **GNU Emacs** configuration for python, go and rust.

It requires Emacs version 29 or higher. If needed, you can change the MELPA repository source.

Some shortcuts can be customized, such as `neotree` with `C-c C-t`.

I hope it is a lightweight editor.

There might be many configurations that still need to be adjusted.

# Installation

1. Run :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aoaeoe/emacs.d ~/.emacs.d
```

2. Launch emacs and wait the package installation.
